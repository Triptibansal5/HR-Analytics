Power BI - Data Visualization
Data Used
Data used to make the report is added to the file section named "HR ANALYTICS" which is a .xlsx file.

Problem Statement
The report that was prepared initially in Excel and had to be migrated/reflect it into Power BI. I studied the report as to what visuals are used , DAX used to create calculated columns and measures and prepared the same report in Power BI.

Steps followed
Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a .xlsx file.
Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column salary", "column age" & "column attrition" options to check for any error or empty data values.
Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present.
Step 5 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
Step 6 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added as needed.










Outcomes Achieved

This was my first project report, I made in Power BI after completing Power BI training. Tt was just to practice my skills in a practical problem so that I learn from my mistakes and uncover my depth of knowledge of the tool which i did and was a good experience to do so
